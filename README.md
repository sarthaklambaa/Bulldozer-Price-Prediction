## Data Preprocessing

The original dataset had a significant amount of missing data, requiring careful handling to ensure the quality and reliability of the machine-learning model. The following preprocessing steps were undertaken:

- Missing numerical values were filled using the median of the data. This approach is robust to outliers and helps maintain the statistical properties of the feature.
- Categorical variables represented as objects were converted into a categorical data type. This conversion not only enhances memory efficiency but also enables better representation of categorical variables during model training.

- **Preparing the Dataset:**
  - The dataset was carefully prepared for training the machine-learning model. This involved encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features if necessary, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

These preprocessing steps play a crucial role in ensuring the robustness and generalization capability of the machine-learning model, allowing it to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

## Model Used

For this project, we employed the following machine-learning model:

- **Random Forest Regressor:**
  - Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm known for its versatility and ability to handle complex datasets. In regression tasks, it can effectively predict numerical values, making it suitable for predicting bulldozer prices in this project.
